README
=======

A python script for archiving content from coursera.org for offline reference. Originally forked from https://github.com/abhirama/coursera-download but significantly cleaned up and enhanced. 

Status
------

Should pretty much work as expected, code could still use some further cleanup, documentation and polish.

Usage
-----

See: python download.py -h

Example usage:

python download.py -u myusername -p mypassword -d /my/coursera/courses algoclass2012
